Subject Matter:
- Beer Glass collector app

Short description:

Beer glasses are collector items. These glasses are custom
made for each brand and some brands have special editions. Our
app will allow the user to enter their user code. It will get all the
glasses they have drank from. Users can scan a beer glass they
havent (or already have) drank from to get more information about
the company, and the glass they are drinking from. (Type, history
of the glass, special edition, etc). Users can then rate the design of
the glass. It will be stored in the json server.

In the main menu users will see their collection of glasses
together with the rating they gave to it.
